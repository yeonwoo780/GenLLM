Recent work has made\\nclear that the hardware and software challenges are still considerable but has\\nalso opened paths towards solutions.Comment: 24 pages, 2 figure,\\n* Paper URLs: ['http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.09347']\\n-----\\n* ID: 129348586,\\n* Title: Machine Learning by Unitary Tensor Network of Hierarchical Tree\\n  Structure,\\n* Published Date: 2019-03-10T00:00:00+00:00,\\n* Authors: Liu, Ding and Ran, Shi-Ju and Wittek, Peter and Peng, Cheng and Garc\\u00eda, Raul Bl\\u00e1zquez and Su, Gang and Lewenstein, Maciej,\\n* Abstract: The resemblance between the methods used in quantum-many body physics and in\\nmachine learning has drawn considerable attention. In particular, tensor\\nnetworks (TNs) and deep learning architectures bear striking similarities to\\nthe extent that TNs can be used for machine learning. Previous results used\\none-dimensional TNs in image recognition, showing limited scalability and\\nflexibilities. In this work, we train two-dimensional hierarchical TNs to solve\\nimage recognition problems, using a training algorithm derived from the\\nmulti-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz. This approach introduces\\nmathematical connections among quantum many-body physics, quantum information\\ntheory, and machine learning. While keeping the TN unitary in the training\\nphase, TN states are defined, which encode classes of images into quantum\\nmany-body states. We study the quantum features of the TN states, including\\nquantum entanglement and fidelity. We find these quantities could be properties\\nthat characterize the image classes, as well as the machine learning tasks.Comment: 6 pages, 4 figure,\\n* Paper URLs: ['http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.04833']\\n-----\\n* ID: 29557092,\\n* Title: Blind quantum machine learning,\\n* Published Date: 2015-07-26T01:00:00+01:00,\\n* Authors: Sheng, Yu-Bo and Zhou, Lan,\\n* Abstract: Blind quantum machine learning (BQML) enables a classical client with little\\nquantum technology to delegate a remote quantum machine learning to the quantum\\nserver in such a approach that the privacy data is preserved. Here we propose\\nthe first BQML protocol that the client can classify two-dimensional vectors to\\ndifferent clusters, resorting to a remote small-scale photon quantum\\ncomputation processor. During the protocol, the client is only required to\\nrotate and measure the single qubit. The protocol is secure without leaking any\\nrelevant information to the Eve. Any eavesdropper who attempts to intercept and\\ndisturb the learning process can be noticed. In principle, this protocol can be\\nused to classify high dimensional vectors and may provide a new viewpoint and\\napplication for quantum machine learning.Comment: 5 pages, 1 figure,\\n* Paper URLs: ['http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.07195']\\n-----\\n* ID: 141534527,\\n* Title: Experimental Machine Learning of Quantum States,\\n* Published Date: 2018-06-21T01:00:00+01:00,\\n* Authors: Gao, Jun and Qiao, Lu-Feng and Jiao, Zhi-Qiang and Ma, Yue-Chi and Hu, Cheng-Qiu and Ren, Ruo-Jing and Yang, Ai-Lin and Tang, Hao and Yung, Man-Hong and Jin, Xian-Min,\\n* Abstract: Quantum information technologies provide promising applications in\\ncommunication and computation, while machine learning has become a powerful\\ntechnique for extracting meaningful structures in 'big data'. A crossover\\nbetween quantum information and machine learning represents a new\\ninterdisciplinary area stimulating progresses in both fields. Traditionally, a\\nquantum state is characterized by quantum state tomography, which is a\\nresource-consuming process when scaled up. Here we experimentally demonstrate a\\nmachine-learning approach to construct a quantum-state classifier for\\nidentifying the separability of quantum states. We show that it is possible to\\nexperimentally train an artificial neural network to efficiently learn and\\nclassify quantum states, without the need of obtaining the full information of\\nthe states. We also show how adding a hidden layer of neurons to the neural\\nnetwork can significantly boost the performance of the state classifier. These\\nresults shed new light on how classification of quantum states can be achieved\\nwith limited resources, and represent a step towards machine-learning-based\\napplications in quantum information processing.Comment: 7 pages, 6 figure,\\n* Paper URLs: ['http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.00456']\\n-----\\n* ID: 25057605,\\n* Title: An introduction to quantum machine learning,\\n* Published Date: 2014-09-10T01:00:00+01:00,\\n* Authors: Schuld, M. and Sinayskiy, I. and Petruccione, F.,\\n* Abstract: Machine learning algorithms learn a desired input-output relation from\\nexamples in order to interpret new inputs. This is important for tasks such as\\nimage and speech recognition or strategy optimisation, with growing\\napplications in the IT industry.

In this work, we introduce the \\\\textit{quantum-assisted\\nHelmholtz machine:} a hybrid quantum-classical framework with the potential of\\ntackling high-dimensional real-world machine learning datasets on continuous\\nvariables. Instead of using quantum computers only to assist deep learning, as\\nprevious approaches have suggested, we use deep learning to extract a\\nlow-dimensional binary representation of data, suitable for processing on\\nrelatively small quantum computers. Then, the quantum hardware and deep\\nlearning architecture work together to train an unsupervised generative model.\\nWe demonstrate this concept using 1644 quantum bits of a D-Wave 2000Q quantum\\ndevice to model a sub-sampled version of the MNIST handwritten digit dataset\\nwith 16x16 continuous valued pixels. Although we illustrate this concept on a\\nquantum annealer, adaptations to other quantum platforms, such as ion-trap\\ntechnologies or superconducting gate-model architectures, could be explored\\nwithin this flexible framework.Comment: 11 pages, 2 figures.

Such machines could learn knowledge\\nfrom what people taught them and do works according to the knowledge. In\\npractical learning cases, the data is often extremely complicated and large,\\nthus classical learning machines often need huge computational resources.\\nQuantum machine learning algorithm, on the other hand, could be exponentially\\nfaster than classical machines using quantum parallelism. Here, we demonstrate\\na quantum machine learning algorithm on a four-qubit NMR test bench to solve an\\noptical character recognition problem, also known as the handwriting\\nrecognition. The quantum machine learns standard character fonts and then\\nrecognize handwritten characters from a set with two candidates. To our best\\nknowledge, this is the first artificial intelligence realized on a quantum\\nprocessor. Due to the widespreading importance of artificial intelligence and\\nits tremendous consuming of computational resources, quantum speedup would be\\nextremely attractive against the challenges from the Big Data.Comment: 7 pages, 4 figure,\\n* Paper URLs: ['http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.1054']\\n-----\\n* ID: 154985574,\\n* Title: Smooth input preparation for quantum and quantum-inspired machine\\n  learning,\\n* Published Date: 2019-08-02T01:00:00+01:00,\\n* Authors: Zhao, Zhikuan and Fitzsimons, Jack K. and Rebentrost, Patrick and Dunjko, Vedran and Fitzsimons, Joseph F.,\\n* Abstract: Machine learning has recently emerged as a fruitful area for finding\\npotential quantum computational advantage. Many of the quantum enhanced machine\\nlearning algorithms critically hinge upon the ability to efficiently produce\\nstates proportional to high-dimensional data points stored in a quantum\\naccessible memory. Even given query access to exponentially many entries stored\\nin a database, the construction of which is considered a one-off overhead, it\\nhas been argued that the cost of preparing such amplitude-encoded states may\\noffset any exponential quantum advantage. Here we prove using smoothed\\nanalysis, that if the data-analysis algorithm is robust against small\\nentry-wise input perturbation, state preparation can always be achieved with\\nconstant queries. This criterion is typically satisfied in realistic machine\\nlearning applications, where input data is subjective to moderate noise. Our\\nresults are equally applicable to the recent seminal progress in\\nquantum-inspired algorithms, where specially constructed databases suffice for\\npolylogarithmic classical algorithm in low-rank cases. The consequence of our\\nfinding is that for the purpose of practical machine learning, polylogarithmic\\nprocessing time is possible under a general and flexible input model with\\nquantum algorithms or quantum-inspired classical algorithms in the low-rank\\ncases.Comment: 5 pages, 1 figur,\\n* Paper URLs: ['http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.00281']\"\n",

This monumental achievement allows researchers to uncover the correlations between DNA sequences and biological functions. Today, this movement has propelled modern geneticists toward the peak of human health sciences: the ability to manipulate the very essence of our being. With the aid of Genetic Engineering, scientists now possess the capability to alter the fundamental framework of our genetic code, offering the potential to cure fatal genetic disorders alongside other new therapeutic applications. With this powerful application geneticists have hit a break: determining the ethical boundaries that govern the utilization of this powerful technology. The line between therapeutic interventions and ethically uncertain practices, such as human enhancement or reckless experimentation, grows increasingly tenuous. Despite the remarkable promise of gene editing, it is necessary to navigate this ethical predicament cautiously. Gene editing holds immense promise as a therapeutic tool, continually making groundbreaking discoveries. However, this progress is accompanied by ethical and technological problems that require consideration. To present the current landscape of gene editing, this literature review focuses on the latest advancements in genetic engineering, examining its applications, ethical dilemmas, and the regulatory debate in the United States. This review aims to provide insights into the rapidly changing dimension of gene editing, understanding its potential, challenges, and governance in biomedical research,\\n* Paper URLs: ['https://scholarworks.uni.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1929&context=hpt']\\n-----\\n* ID: 592787179,\\n* Title: Progress and harmonization of gene editing to treat human diseases: Proceeding of COST Action CA21113 GenE-HumDi,\\n* Published Date: 2023-01-01T00:00:00+00:00,\\n* Authors: Cavazza A. and Hendel A. and Bak R.

Recently, COST Action funded the \\u201cGenome Editing to treat Human Diseases\\u201d (GenE-HumDi) network, uniting various stakeholders such as pharmaceutical companies, academic institutions, regulatory agencies, biotech firms, and patient advocacy groups. GenE-HumDi's primary objective is to expedite the application of genome editing for therapeutic purposes in treating human diseases. To achieve this goal, GenE-HumDi is organized in several working groups, each focusing on specific aspects. These groups aim to enhance genome editing technologies, assess delivery systems, address safety concerns, promote clinical translation, and develop regulatory guidelines. The network seeks to establish standard procedures and guidelines for these areas to standardize scientific practices and facilitate knowledge sharing. Furthermore, GenE-HumDi aims to communicate its findings to the public in accessible yet rigorous language, emphasizing genome editing's potential to revolutionize the treatment of many human diseases. The inaugural GenE-HumDi meeting, held in Granada, Spain, in March 2023, featured presentations from experts in the field, discussing recent breakthroughs in delivery methods, safety measures, clinical translation, and regulatory aspects related to gene editing,\\n* Paper URLs: ['https://iris.unimore.it/bitstream/11380/1327197/2/1-s2.0-S2162253123002846-main.pdf']\\n-----\\n* ID: 614769142,\\n* Title: iPSC-derived liver organoids and inherited bleeding disorders : potential and future perspectives,\\n* Published Date: 2024-08-05T15:30:06+01:00,\\n* Authors: Roman, Giacomo and Stavik, Benedicte and Lauritzen, Knut H. and Sandset, Per Morten and Harrison, Sean P. and Sullivan, Gareth J. and Chollet, Maria Eugenia,\\n* Abstract: Funding: This work was made possible with funding from the Norwegian Research Council (325869) and the South-Eastern Norway Regional Health Authority (2019071).The bleeding phenotype of hereditary coagulation disorders is caused by the low or undetectable activity of the proteins involved in hemostasis, due to a broad spectrum of genetic alterations. Most of the affected coagulation factors are produced in the liver. Therefore, two-dimensional (2D) cultures of primary human hepatocytes and recombinant overexpression of the factors in non-human cell lines have been primarily used to mimic disease pathogenesis and as a model for innovative therapeutic strategies. However, neither human nor animal cells fully represent the hepatocellular biology and do not harbor the exact genetic background of the patient. As a result, the inability of the current in vitro models in recapitulating the in vivo situation has limited the studies of these inherited coagulation disorders. Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell (iPSC) technology offers a possible solution to overcome these limitations by reprogramming patient somatic cells into an embryonic-like pluripotent state, thus giving the possibility of generating an unlimited number of liver cells needed for modeling or therapeutic purposes. By combining this potential and the recent advances in the Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 technology, it allows for the generation of autologous and gene corrected liver cells in the form of three-dimensional (3D) liver organoids. The organoids recapitulate cellular composition and organization of the liver, providing a more physiological model to study the biology of coagulation proteins and modeling hereditary coagulation disorders. This advanced methodology can pave the way for the development of cell-based therapeutic approaches to treat inherited coagulation disorders. In this review we will explore the use of liver organoids as a state-of-the-art methodology for modeling coagulation factors disorders and the possibilities of using organoid technology to treat the disease.Peer reviewe,\\n* Paper URLs: ['https://research-repository.st-andrews.ac.uk/bitstream/10023/30326/1/Roman-iPSC-derived-liver-organoids-FPHYS-14-1094249-CCBY.pdf']\\n-----\\n* ID: 596247487,\\n* Title: Emerging Therapies in Retinal Diseases: From Gene Therapy to Stem Cell Interventions,\\n* Published Date: 2023-09-01T01:00:00+01:00,\\n* Authors: Renuks Sarwate, Rohit Kundap , Girish Arun Gadre, Prajakta Patil, D. B. Shirke,,\\n* Abstract: Retinal disorders pose a serious threat to eye health as they frequently result in blindness and reduced vision. There is hope that the treatment of many illnesses will be revolutionised by emerging medicines, especially gene therapy and stem cell approaches. This study explores the current state of these innovative therapies and how they could affect retinal disorders. By replacing or repairing damaged genes, gene therapy, which uses precise genetic modification, shows promise in treating hereditary retinal problems. Clinical trials have yielded promising results, including improvements in visual function and optimism for patients with illnesses such as choroideremia and Leber congenital amaurosis. Regenerative approaches are provided by stem cell therapies, which restore damaged retinal tissues. Numerous stem cell varieties, including as embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells, show promise in preclinical research and early-stage clinical trials, suggesting that cell replacement techniques may be a viable means of recovering vision. On the other hand, effective delivery, long-term safety, and ethical issues provide obstacles on the path to clinical application. To fully realise the transformational potential of these medicines, it is imperative to address these obstacles. There is potential for improved visual outcomes, targeted therapies, and personalised care as gene therapy and stem cell interventions advance. These developments highlight the promising future of treating retinal illnesses,\\n* Paper URLs: ['https://ijritcc.org/index.php/ijritcc/article/download/9421/7238']\\n-----\\n* ID: 643778551,\\n* Title: Challenges and Considerations of Preclinical Development for iPSC-Based Myogenic Cell Therapy,\\n* Published Date: 2024-03-29T07:00:00+00:00,\\n* Authors: Sun, Congshan and Serra, Carlo and Kalicharan, Brianna Harley and Harding, Jeffrey and Rao, Mahendra,\\n* Abstract: Cell therapies derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) offer a promising avenue in the field of regenerative medicine due to iPSCs\\\\u27 expandability, immune compatibility, and pluripotent potential. An increasing number of preclinical and clinical trials have been carried out, exploring the application of iPSC-based therapies for challenging diseases, such as muscular dystrophies. The unique syncytial nature of skeletal muscle allows stem/progenitor cells to integrate, forming new myonuclei and restoring the expression of genes affected by myopathies. This characteristic makes genome-editing techniques especially attractive in these therapies. With genetic modification and iPSC lineage specification methodologies, immune-compatible healthy iPSC-derived muscle cells can be manufactured to reverse the progression of muscle diseases or facilitate tissue regeneration. Despite this exciting advancement, much of the development of iPSC-based therapies for muscle diseases and tissue regeneration is limited to academic settings, with no successful clinical translation reported. The unknown differentiation process in vivo, potential tumorigenicity, and epigenetic abnormality of transplanted cells are preventing their clinical application. In this review, we give an overview on preclinical development of iPSC-derived myogenic cell transplantation therapies including processes related to iPSC-derived myogenic cells such as differentiation, scaling-up, delivery, and cGMP compliance. And we discuss the potential challenges of each step of clinical translation.

Of particular interest are the monogenic rare bone mass disorders, with the underlying genetic defect contributing to either low or high bone mass phenotype. Extensive, deep phenotyping coupled with high-throughput, cost-effective genotyping is crucial in the characterization and diagnosis of affected individuals. Massive parallel sequencing efforts have been instrumental in the discovery of novel causal genes that merit functional validation using in vitro and ex vivo cell-based techniques, and in vivo models, mainly mice and zebrafish. These translational models also serve as an excellent platform for therapeutic discovery, bridging the gap between basic science research and the clinic. Altogether, genetic studies of monogenic rare bone mass disorders have broadened our knowledge on molecular signaling pathways coordinating bone development and metabolism, disease inheritance patterns, development of new and improved bone biomarkers, and identification of novel drug targets. In this comprehensive review we describe approaches to further enhance the innovative processes taking discoveries from clinic to bench, and then back to clinic in rare bone mass disorders. We highlight the importance of cross laboratory collaboration to perform functional validation in multiple model systems after identification of a novel disease gene. We describe the monogenic forms of rare low and high rare bone mass disorders known to date, provide a roadmap to unravel the genetic determinants of monogenic rare bone mass disorders using proper phenotyping and genotyping methods, and describe different genetic validation approaches paving the way for future treatments,\\n* Paper URLs: ['https://diposit.ub.edu/dspace/bitstream/2445/195163/1/714245.pdf']\\n-----\\n* ID: 588290687,\\n* Title: Investigating the Potential of a Cell-Based Gene Editing Therapy for Inherited Metabolic Liver Disease,\\n* Published Date: 2023-08-01T08:00:00+01:00,\\n* Authors: Ates, Ilayda,\\n* Abstract: Inherited metabolic diseases (IMDs) affecting the liver are relatively rare but collectively have a prevalence of 1 in 800 live births. These diseases result from autosomal recessive single-gene mutations, leading to organ dysfunction and potentially fatal consequences if left untreated. One potential therapeutic strategy for IMDs of the liver involves using CRISPR-Cas9-induced loss of function mutations. However, translating this approach into the clinic is limited by the need for safe and effective CRISPR delivery methods. Adeno-associated viral vectors (AAVs), commonly used for CRISPR delivery, are associated with significant safety and efficacy concerns, including risks for immunogenicity, off-target mutagenesis, and genotoxicity due to persistent Cas9 expression. Therefore, alternative delivery approaches are needed. In this study, we explore the safety and efficacy of electroporation as an alternative to viral delivery methods for ex vivo gene editing therapy for IMDs of the liver. Our strategy involves isolating hepatocytes from the resected liver of a patient, delivering CRISPR components into the hepatocytes via electroporation ex vivo, and subsequently transplanting the edited hepatocytes back into the patient\\\\u27s liver to replace the native hepatocytes with healthy gene-edited ones. Compared to systemic delivery, this approach offers advantages such as cell-specific editing, the potential to screen for off-target effects, and the opportunity to expand or cryopreserve gene-edited hepatocytes for transplantation when needed. The success of a cell-based therapy will require the edited hepatocytes to engraft and replace approximately 5-10% of the liver mass and persist for the patient\\\\u27s lifetime. iii We develop technical protocols to advance a cell-based therapeutic approach. First, we optimize hepatocyte isolation protocols to achieve high viability in freshly isolated primary hepatocytes for downstream delivery. Second, we established a mouse model for primary hepatocyte isolation and transplantation. After that, we show a successful cell therapy approach to reprogram metabolic pathways by electroporating CRISPR-Cas9 mRNA and RNPs to disrupt the gene encoding 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (Hpd) in primary hepatocytes ex vivo, followed by transplantation to treat a mouse model of hereditary tyrosinemia type 1 (HT1). Third, to assess the broader applicability of our strategy, we explore a novel cell-based gene editing approach in a mouse model of familial hypercholesterolemia. Specifically, we demonstrate clonal expansion and liver repopulation by gene-edited hepatocytes after transplantation by transient administration of acetaminophen. This study aims to provide valuable insights into the efficacy and safety of electroporation as a nonviral delivery approach for cell-based gene editing therapies for liver disease. These advancements can be applied to many inherited metabolic liver disorders and are a step toward autologous cell therapy in the liver,\\n* Paper URLs: ['https://tigerprints.clemson.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4432&context=all_dissertations']\\n-----\\n* ID: 617035313,\\n* Title: A roadmap for affordable genetic medicines,\\n* Published Date: 2024-07-17T01:00:00+01:00,\\n* Authors: Kliegman, Melinda and Zaghlula, Manar and Abrahamson, Susan and Esensten, Jonathan H and Wilson, Ross and Urnov, Fyodor D and Doudna, Jennifer A,\\n* Abstract: Nineteen genetic therapies have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to date, a number that now includes the first CRISPR genome editing therapy for sickle cell disease, CASGEVY (exagamglogene autotemcel). This extraordinary milestone is widely celebrated because of the promise for future genome editing treatments of previously intractable genetic disorders and cancers. At the same time, such genetic therapies are the most expensive drugs on the market, with list prices exceeding $4 million per patient. Although all approved cell and gene therapies trace their origins to academic or government research institutions, reliance on for-profit pharmaceutical companies for subsequent development and commercialization results in prices that prioritize recouping investments, paying for candidate product failures, and meeting investor and shareholder expectations. To increase affordability and access, sustainable discovery-to-market alternatives are needed that address system-wide deficiencies. Here, we present recommendations of a multi-disciplinary task force assembled to chart such a path.

To optimize metabolism and reach optimal productivity, synthetic biology has developed various genetic devices to engineer microbial systems by gene editing, high-throughput protein engineering, and dynamic regulation. However, current synthetic biology methodologies still rely heavily on manual design, laborious testing, and exhaustive analysis. The emerging interdisciplinary field of artificial intelligence (AI) and biology has become pivotal in addressing the remaining challenges. AI-aided microbial production harnesses the power of processing, learning, and predicting vast amounts of biological data within seconds, providing outputs with high probability. With well-trained AI models, the conventional Design-Build-Test (DBT) cycle has been transformed into a multidimensional Design-Build-Test-Learn-Predict (DBTLP) workflow, leading to significantly improved operational efficiency and reduced labor consumption. Here, we comprehensively review the main components and recent advances in AI-aided microbial production, focusing on genome annotation, AI-aided protein engineering, artificial functional protein design, and AI-enabled pathway prediction. Finally, we discuss the challenges of integrating novel AI techniques into biology and propose the potential of large language models (LLMs) in advancing microbial production,\\n* Paper URLs: ['http://cdr.lib.unc.edu/downloads/41687x81x']\\n-----\\n* ID: 568399466,\\n* Title: Protein-DNA interaction prediction and protein structure modeling by machine learning,\\n* Published Date: 2023-01-08T00:00:00+00:00,\\n* Authors: Chen, Chen,\\n* Abstract: Proteins are large, complex molecules that perform most essential functions within organisms. In this work, we mainly focus on two important aspects that determine their functional properties: the tertiary structure of the proteins and their interaction patterns with the genome. Understanding these properties brings valuable insights on the fundamentals of biology and result in new applications in areas such as agriculture, precision medicine, and drug discovery. The recent developments of bioinformatics and structural biology, machine learning, in particular deep learning has proven to be extremely powerful in inference and interpretation of experimental observations by taking advantage of the large amount data publicly available today. We aim to propose novel machine learning frameworks that can both extract information from higher-level features, and provide explainability for meaningful insights beyond the predictions as well. However, due to the volatility of biology phenomena, the design of data processing and modeling need to be extensive for features from the the proteins. Also, the different geophysical measurements (1D, 2D and 3D) of the protein properties bring new challenges for the selection of model architectures that can effectively leverage different forms of data structure. In this dissertation, four major contributions are described. First, DeepGRN, is a method for transcription binding site prediction using 1D transformer-based network. Second, GNET2, is a data-assisted method to infer the interactions between proteins and genes from gene expression data using decision tree and information theory. Third, ATTContact, is a tool for protein contact prediction based on 2D residual neural networks with attention mechanism. Finally, EnQA, a method based on 3D equivariant graph networks for protein model quality assessment and selection of the most accurate model as the final protein structure prediction. All the methods described have been released as open source software, and are freely available to the scientific community.Includes bibliographical references,\\n* Paper URLs: ['https://mospace.umsystem.edu/xmlui/bitstream/10355/94056/1/ChenChenResearch.pdf']\\n-----\\n* ID: 617937459,\\n* Title: Machine and deep learning methods for predicting 3D genome organization,\\n* Published Date: 2024-03-04T00:00:00+00:00,\\n* Authors: Wall, Brydon P.

Experimental determination of protein and protein complex structures can be expensive and difficult. Computational prediction of protein and protein complex structures has therefore been an open challenge for decades. Recent advances in computational structure prediction techniques have resulted in increasingly accurate protein structure predictions. These techniques include methods that leverage information about coevolving residues to predict residue interactions and that apply deep learning techniques to enable better prediction of residue contacts and protein structures. Prior to the work outlined in this thesis, coevolution-based methods and deep learning had been shown to improve the prediction of single protein domains or single protein chains.  \\n\\n\\n\\nMost proteins in living organisms do not function on their own but interact with other proteins either through transient interactions or by forming stable protein complexes. Knowledge of protein complex structures can be useful for biological and disease research, drug discovery and protein engineering. Unfortunately, a large number of protein complexes do not have experimental structures or close homolog structures that can be used as templates. In this thesis, methods previously developed and applied to the de novo prediction of single protein domains or protein monomer chains  were modified and leveraged for the prediction of protein heterodimer and homodimer complexes. A number of coevolution-based tools and deep learning methods are explored for the purpose of predicting inter-chain and intra-chain residue contacts in protein dimers. These contacts are combined with existing protein docking methods to explore the prediction of homodimers and heterodimers. \\n\\n\\n\\nOverall, the work in this thesis demonstrates the promise of leveraging coevolution and deep-learning for the prediction of protein complexes, shows improvements in protein complex prediction tasks achieved using coevolution based methods and deep learning methods, and demonstrates remaining challenges in protein complex prediction,\\n* Paper URLs: ['https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/10172986/2/PhDThesis_NikitaDesai_Final.pdf']\\n-----\\n* ID: 614996534,\\n* Title: Rigid Protein-Protein Docking via Equivariant Elliptic-Paraboloid\\n  Interface Prediction,\\n* Published Date: 2024-01-17T00:00:00+00:00,\\n* Authors: Yu, Ziyang and Huang, Wenbing and Liu, Yang,\\n* Abstract: The study of rigid protein-protein docking plays an essential role in a\\nvariety of tasks such as drug design and protein engineering. Recently, several\\nlearning-based methods have been proposed for the task, exhibiting much faster\\ndocking speed than those computational methods. In this paper, we propose a\\nnovel learning-based method called ElliDock, which predicts an elliptic\\nparaboloid to represent the protein-protein docking interface. To be specific,\\nour model estimates elliptic paraboloid interfaces for the two input proteins\\nrespectively, and obtains the roto-translation transformation for docking by\\nmaking two interfaces coincide. By its design, ElliDock is independently\\nequivariant with respect to arbitrary rotations/translations of the proteins,\\nwhich is an indispensable property to ensure the generalization of the docking\\nprocess. Experimental evaluations show that ElliDock achieves the fastest\\ninference time among all compared methods and is strongly competitive with\\ncurrent state-of-the-art learning-based models such as DiffDock-PP and Multimer\\nparticularly for antibody-antigen docking.Comment: ICLR 202,\\n* Paper URLs: ['http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08986']\\n-----\\n* ID: 567839573,\\n* Title: Multi-level Protein Representation Learning for Blind Mutational Effect\\n  Prediction,\\n* Published Date: 2023-06-07T01:00:00+01:00,\\n* Authors: Tan, Yang and Zhou, Bingxin and Jiang, Yuanhong and Wang, Yu Guang and Hong, Liang,\\n* Abstract: Directed evolution plays an indispensable role in protein engineering that\\nrevises existing protein sequences to attain new or enhanced functions.\\nAccurately predicting the effects of protein variants necessitates an in-depth\\nunderstanding of protein structure and function.

However, most binding site prediction methods are tested by providing crystallised ligand-bound (holo) structures as input. This testing regime is insufficient to understand the performance on novel protein targets where experimental structures are not available. An alternative option is to provide computationally predicted protein structures, but this is not commonly tested. However, due to the training data used, computationally-predicted protein structures tend to be extremely accurate, and are often biased toward a holo conformation. In this study we describe and benchmark IF-SitePred, a protein-ligand binding site prediction method which is based on the labelling of ESM-IF1 protein language model embeddings combined with point cloud annotation and clustering. We show that not only is IF-SitePred competitive with state-of-the-art methods when predicting binding sites on experimental structures, but it performs better on proxies for novel proteins where low accuracy has been simulated by molecular dynamics. Finally, IF-SitePred outperforms other methods if ensembles of predicted protein structures are generated,\\n* Paper URLs: ['https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:b9c74300-f002-46d6-bd28-c78ba17784c2/files/rkp78gh474']\\n-----\\n* ID: 615101331,\\n* Title: Endowing Protein Language Models with Structural Knowledge,\\n* Published Date: 2024-01-26T00:00:00+00:00,\\n* Authors: Chen, Dexiong and Hartout, Philip and Pellizzoni, Paolo and Oliver, Carlos and Borgwardt, Karsten,\\n* Abstract: Understanding the relationships between protein sequence, structure and\\nfunction is a long-standing biological challenge with manifold implications\\nfrom drug design to our understanding of evolution. Recently, protein language\\nmodels have emerged as the preferred method for this challenge, thanks to their\\nability to harness large sequence databases. Yet, their reliance on expansive\\nsequence data and parameter sets limits their flexibility and practicality in\\nreal-world scenarios. Concurrently, the recent surge in computationally\\npredicted protein structures unlocks new opportunities in protein\\nrepresentation learning. While promising, the computational burden carried by\\nsuch complex data still hinders widely-adopted practical applications. To\\naddress these limitations, we introduce a novel framework that enhances protein\\nlanguage models by integrating protein structural data. Drawing from recent\\nadvances in graph transformers, our approach refines the self-attention\\nmechanisms of pretrained language transformers by integrating structural\\ninformation with structure extractor modules. This refined model, termed\\nProtein Structure Transformer (PST), is further pretrained on a small protein\\nstructure database, using the same masked language modeling objective as\\ntraditional protein language models. Empirical evaluations of PST demonstrate\\nits superior parameter efficiency relative to protein language models, despite\\nbeing pretrained on a dataset comprising only 542K structures. Notably, PST\\nconsistently outperforms the state-of-the-art foundation model for protein\\nsequences, ESM-2, setting a new benchmark in protein function prediction.

      "This paper introduces the Protein Structure Transformer (PST), a novel framework that integrates protein structural data into transformer-based protein language models. The key architectural innovation is the refinement of self-attention mechanisms using structure extractor modules, inspired by graph transformers. PST is pretrained on a relatively small protein structure database (542K structures) and demonstrates superior parameter efficiency and predictive performance compared to state-of-the-art sequence-based models like ESM-2. The authors provide empirical validation, showing that PST outperforms ESM-2 in protein function prediction tasks, setting a new benchmark.  \n",

       "**Published:** 2024  \n",
       "**Summary:**  \n",
       "This paper introduces the Protein Structure Transformer (PST), a novel framework that integrates protein structural data into transformer-based protein language models. The key architectural innovation is the refinement of self-attention mechanisms using structure extractor modules, inspired by graph transformers. PST is pretrained on a relatively small protein structure database (542K structures) and demonstrates superior parameter efficiency and predictive performance compared to state-of-the-art sequence-based models like ESM-2. The authors provide empirical validation, showing that PST outperforms ESM-2 in protein function prediction tasks, setting a new benchmark.  \n",
